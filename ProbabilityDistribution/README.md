# Distributions Repository

This repository contains implementations and examples of various probability distributions commonly used in statistics.

## Included Distributions

### 1. Normal Distribution
The Normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a continuous probability distribution that is symmetric and bell-shaped. It's characterized by its mean and standard deviation.

Use Case: **Normal Distribution in eCommerce: Product Delivery Times**

**Analysis**: Analyzing historical data, the eCommerce platform observes that delivery times for a specific product category follow a Normal distribution with a mean delivery time of 3 days and a standard deviation of 0.5 days.

**Quality Control**: Using this distribution, the platform sets quality control standards. For instance, they consider any delivery taking longer than 4 days or less than 2 days as a deviation from the expected delivery time.

**Decision Making**: When monitoring new deliveries, the platform assesses whether the delivery time falls within the expected range (based on the Normal distribution parameters) to ensure customer satisfaction. This helps in deciding whether to investigate potential delays or discrepancies in delivery times.

**Improvement**: If there's a consistent shift in delivery times (e.g., more deliveries taking longer than 4 days), the platform investigates operational processes, logistics, or external factors affecting delivery to rectify and optimize the delivery system.

In this scenario, leveraging the Normal distribution aids in setting quality standards, making decisions about delivery times, and identifying areas for improvement in managing product deliveries within the eCommerce platform.

### 2. Uniform Distribution
The Uniform distribution represents a continuous probability distribution where all outcomes within a given range are equally likely.

Use Case: **Uniform Distribution in eCommerce: Product Pricing Strategy**

**Analysis**: Analyzing pricing data for a specific product category, the eCommerce platform identifies that prices for products in this category follow a Uniform distribution between $20 and $50.

**Price Control**: Utilizing this distribution, the platform sets pricing control guidelines. For instance, they ensure that no product is priced below $20 or above $50 to maintain a balanced pricing structure within the category.

**Pricing Decisions**: When introducing new products or adjusting prices, the platform ensures that the proposed price falls within the predefined range based on the Uniform distribution parameters. This helps in maintaining competitive yet consistent pricing for the category.

**Market Strategy**: By understanding the Uniform distribution of prices, the platform might strategically promote products priced closer to the lower or upper bounds to attract different segments of customers seeking varying price ranges.

**Analysis and Optimization**: If there's a notable shift in the distribution (e.g., products consistently priced at the extremes), the platform analyzes market trends or consumer behavior to optimize the pricing strategy within the defined range.

In this scenario, leveraging the Uniform distribution aids in maintaining pricing control, making informed pricing decisions, devising market strategies, and optimizing product pricing within the eCommerce platform.
