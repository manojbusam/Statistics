# Distributions Repository

This repository contains implementations and examples of various probability distributions commonly used in statistics.

## Included Distributions

### Normal Distribution
The Normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a continuous probability distribution that is symmetric and bell-shaped. It's characterized by its mean and standard deviation.

### Binomial Distribution
The Binomial distribution describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials, each with the same probability of success.

### Poisson Distribution
The Poisson distribution models the number of events occurring within a fixed interval of time or space, given a known average rate of occurrence.

## Implementation and Usage
Each distribution has its implementation within this repository, along with examples showcasing how to use these implementations in various scenarios.

### Folder Structure
- `normal_distribution/`: Contains code for the Normal distribution.
- `binomial_distribution/`: Contains code for the Binomial distribution.
- `poisson_distribution/`: Contains code for the Poisson distribution.

### Usage Examples
Within each distribution folder, you'll find code snippets demonstrating how to use the distribution functions and generate random samples from these distributions.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the desired distribution folder.
3. Follow the instructions in the README provided in each folder for specific usage guidelines and examples.
