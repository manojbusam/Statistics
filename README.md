## Statistics

In data science, mean, median, and standard deviation unveil data patterns; logarithms and cosine similarity aid scaling and similarity measurements, while the modified z-score enhances accuracy by detecting outliers, forming a vital toolkit for data analysis.

- **a-mean-median-mode:** 
  - Central tendencies, data distribution summary.
  
- **b-standard-deviation:** 
  - Measures data spread, and variability identification.

- **c-logarithms:** 
  - Scales data, handles exponential relationships.

- **d-cosine-similarity:** 
  - Measures vector similarity, and aids clustering.

- **e-modified-Z-score:** 
  - Outlier detection, enhances analysis accuracy.
